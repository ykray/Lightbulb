## Concept

Lightbulb is a minimal dark theme for Visual Studio Code that intelligently illuminates items of interest, while elegantly fading away unnecessary distractions.

This is a comprehensive theme designed over many years of experimentation with my own VS Code setup, with the goal of a design that increased productivity but was also nice to just _look_ at. **Bright actions** on **subtle surfaces**, splashed over by an **intuitive color palette**. I hope you enjoy this theme as much as I enjoy tinkering on it.

## Extras

- styles [Numbered Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.numbered-bookmarks) and [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) right out of the box
- font used in showcase: `Hack Nerd Font Mono`
- to increase the sidebar's font-size as in showcase:
  - Set `"window.zoomLevel": 0.45`
